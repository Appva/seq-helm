# Datalust Helm charts

[Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes](https://helm.sh/). This repository contains the officially supported Helm chart
for [Seq](https://datalust.co/seq), a search and analysis server for structured application logs.

**For details of how to get started with Seq in Kubernetes, check out [the documentation](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/using-helm).**

Also see the `samples` directory here for a practical walkthrough.
